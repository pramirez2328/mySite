        <p>
          I've had the wonderful experience of turning my passion for programming into a fulfilling professional career.
          I proudly hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Information Systems with a specialization in web development,
          and the joy I find in programming and continuous learning led to the honor of being chosen as class
          valedictorian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my degree, I've actively pursued various tech certifications and even had the exhilarating
          opportunity to attend an intensive 10-week full-stack web development boot camp. My journey has been enriched
          by over a decade of experience as a project manager, where I honed my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and
          meeting deadlines even under pressure. Finding effective solutions to logistical challenges has been a
          consistent aspect of my professional life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I've seamlessly translated these problem-solving abilities into the tech realm by bringing meaningful
          projects to life using cutting-edge technologies. I firmly believe that learning is an everlasting adventure,
          which is why I'm currently juggling my passion with being a part-time student pursuing a Master's degree in
          Software Development at the esteemed University of Boston.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the tech world, I find immense joy in giving back to the community through active involvement with my
          church. It's a wonderful way to unwind and contribute positively to the world around me.
