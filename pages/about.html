          I have had the privilege of transforming my passion for programming into a deeply fulfilling professional
          journey. Holding a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems with a specialization in web development,
          I take immense pride in the path I've carved. My dedication to programming and continuous growth culminated in
          the honor of being selected as the class valedictorian.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my formal education, I've actively pursued diverse tech certifications and seized the
          exhilarating opportunity to attend an intensive 10-week full-stack web development boot camp. This journey has
          been enriched by over a decade of experience as a project manager. Through this role, I finely honed essential
          skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and meeting deadlines even amidst challenging circumstances. Addressing
          logistical hurdles and finding effective solutions has been a consistent theme throughout my professional
          tenure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging my problem-solving skills seamlessly into the tech realm, I've successfully brought meaningful
          projects to fruition using cutting-edge technologies. A significant chapter of this journey was my role as a
          front-end engineer at Snap Inc., where I played a vital part in integrating the Shopping Suite SDK into a
          range of merchant websites. This was a pivotal initiative aimed at uniting Snap’s AR and AI technology into a
          cohesive service, addressing major challenges within the retail industry and positively transforming the
          shopping experience for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my two-year tenure in this position, I shouldered the responsibility of constructing, testing, and
          maintaining a particular demo website. This platform effectively showcased the diverse features of the SDK,
          including Fit Finder, clothing try-on, eyewear try-on, and a 3D viewer. The goal was to provide a
          comprehensive and engaging demonstration of the SDK's capabilities to potential clients and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          My belief in lifelong learning has led me to pursue further education as a part-time student, currently
          undertaking a Master's degree in Software Development at the esteemed University of Boston. Beyond the realm
          of technology, I find immense joy in giving back to the community through active involvement with my church.
          This involvement serves as a source of relaxation and allows me to make a positive contribution to the world
          around me.
