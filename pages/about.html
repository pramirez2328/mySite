          <strong>Pedro Ramirez</strong> turned his programming hobby into a
          professional career. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Computer
          Information Systems with a concentration in web development. The love
          he has for programming and learning was recognized when he was chosen
          as class valedictorian. In addition to his bachelor’s degree, he has
          earned several tech certifications and attended an intense 10-week
          full-stack web development Bootcamp. His expertise in solving problems
          comes from working for more than a decade as a project manager. During
          this time, he gained experience working with teams, dealing with and
          meeting deadlines, as well as, working under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solving logistical problems by implementing meaningful strategies has
          been consistently part of his professional life. Now he has
          transferred his problem-solving skills into the tech world by creating
          real projects using the latest technologies. He believes learning is a
          never-ending journey, so he is planning on obtaining his master’s in
          Computer Science soon.
        </p>
        <p>In his free time, he enjoys doing community work with his church.</p>
