          Embarking on my journey as a web developer in February 2020, I have had the privilege of transforming my
          passion for programming into a profoundly fulfilling and dynamic professional experience. Armed with a
          bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems, specializing in web development, I take immense pride in
          the path I've carved thus far. Notably, my dedication to programming and continuous growth led to the honor of
          being selected as the class valedictorian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complementing my formal education, I actively pursued diverse tech certifications and embraced the
          exhilarating challenge of a 10-week full-stack web development boot camp. Adding a layer of depth to my
          journey, I bring over a decade of experience as a project manager. This role has finely honed crucial skills
          like problem-solving, teamwork, and meeting deadlines, even in challenging circumstances. Addressing
          logistical hurdles and finding practical solutions has been a theme throughout my professional tenure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Integrating my well-honed problem-solving skills into the tech realm, I've successfully brought meaningful
          projects to fruition using cutting-edge technologies. Notably, I played a pivotal role as a front-end engineer
          at Snap Inc., contributing significantly to the integration of the Shopping Suite SDK into various merchant
          websites. This initiative aimed to unite Snap's AR and AI technology, address critical challenges within the
          retail industry, and transform the shopping experience for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my two-year tenure in this position, I constructed, tested, and maintained a demo website that
          effectively showcased the SDK's diverse features, including Fit Finder, clothing try-on, eyewear try-on, and a
          3D viewer. The goal was to provide a comprehensive and engaging demonstration of the SDK's capabilities to
          potential clients and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believing in lifelong learning, I am pursuing a Master's in Software Development as a part-time student at the
          esteemed University of Boston. Beyond the tech realm, I find joy in giving back to the community through
          active involvement with my church. This engagement is a source of relaxation and allows me to contribute
          positively to the world around me.
